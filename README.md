# Basin-wide-rock-physics---3D



This Jupyter notebook extended the Rock Physics Template calculation from 1D to 3D.

Description:

In this notebook, we created a small model grid and filled it with 3D rock physics template (RPT) for shale and sand. The model contains a sand body with gas and oil in it.
